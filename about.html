        <h2>About the Springboks</h2>
        <p>The Springboks are South Africa's national rugby team, known for their successful history and fierce competitiveness in international rugby. They are one of the most prestigious teams globally, having won multiple Rugby World Cup titles, including in 1995, 2007, 2019, and 2023.</p>
        <p>The team’s name, "Springboks," is derived from the antelope species found in southern Africa. The Springboks are known for their strong forward play, physicality, and tactical kicking. Their green and gold kit is iconic, representing the nation's pride and heritage in the sport.</p>
        <p>The Springboks compete in various international tournaments, such as the Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri-Nations), alongside New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. Their historic rivalry with New Zealand’s All Blacks is one of the fiercest in rugby.</p>
